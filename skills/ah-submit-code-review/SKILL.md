# Submit Code Review

Submit a structured code review with line-specific comments to a GitHub pull request. Identifies issues in the current chat session or review file, checks for duplicate comments, and submits the review.

## Input

- **PR number or URL** (required): The pull request identifier. Accepts:
  - Number: `123`
  - Hash-prefixed: `#123`
  - Full URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`
- **Review file path** (optional): Path to a review file produced by `ah-review-code` (e.g., `~/.agents/arinhub/code-reviews/code-review-pr-my-app-123.md`). If provided, issues are extracted from this file instead of the current chat session.

## Procedure

### 1. Resolve PR Identifier

Extract the PR number from the user input. Strip any `#` prefix or parse the number from a URL. Also resolve the repository owner and name for API calls.

```bash
PR_NUMBER=<extracted number>
REPO_INFO=$(gh repo view --json owner,name)
REPO_OWNER=$(echo "$REPO_INFO" | jq -r '.owner.login')
REPO_NAME=$(echo "$REPO_INFO" | jq -r '.name')
```

### 2. Fetch PR Metadata

Gather PR details:

```bash
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json number,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,files,url
```

### 3. Fetch Existing Review Comments

Retrieve all existing review comments to prevent duplication:

```bash
gh api repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments --paginate --jq '.[] | {id, path, line, body, user: .user.login}'
```

Also fetch top-level review bodies:

```bash
gh api repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews --paginate --jq '.[] | {id, body, state, user: .user.login}'
```

### 4. Get Issue List

Get a list of issues from one of these sources (in priority order):

1. **Review file**: If a review file path is provided (e.g., from `ah-review-code` orchestrator), read the file and extract all issues from the `## Issues` section.
2. **Current chat session**: If no review file is specified, collect issues identified during the code review in the current chat session.

For each issue found, record:

- `severity`: One of `High Priority`, `Medium Priority`, or `Low Priority`
- `title`: A short descriptive title for the issue (e.g., "Unvalidated user input passed to SQL query")
- `path`: The relative file path
- `file_in_diff`: Whether the file appears in the PR diff (`true` or `false`). Issues with `file_in_diff: false` cannot be posted as inline thread comments -- they are included in the main review body instead (see Step 7).
- `line`: The specific line number in the new version of the file (must be within the diff hunk). For multi-line issues, this is the **last** line of the range.
- `start_line` (optional): The first line of a multi-line range. Only set when the issue spans more than one line.
- `explanation`: A concise, actionable comment explaining the issue (the "why", not just the "what")
- `suggestion` (optional): Raw replacement code for a concrete fix. Only set for simple, contiguous changes (see **Suggestion conversion rules**). When set, this code replaces lines `start_line` (or `line`) through `line` verbatim. Do not include ` ```suggestion ` fences -- they are added automatically in Step 7. For complex suggestions (multiple diff blocks or non-contiguous changes), do **not** set this field; instead append the diff block(s) to `explanation`.

#### Parsing a review file

The review file from `ah-review-code` uses a different format than the submission API. Apply these transformations when extracting issues:

| Review file field                        | Maps to                                | Transformation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `**Severity:** High Priority`            | `severity`                             | Use the value directly (`High Priority`, `Medium Priority`, or `Low Priority`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Issue heading (`#### <text>`)            | `title`                                | Use the heading text as the title                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `**Suggestion:** ` ` ```diff ``` ` block | `suggestion` or `explanation` appendix | See **Suggestion conversion rules** below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### Suggestion conversion rules

A `**Suggestion:**` section in the review file may contain one or more ` ```diff ``` ` blocks. Apply these rules to decide how to handle it:

**Convert to `suggestion`** (simple case) -- when the suggestion contains **exactly one** diff block **and** all changed lines (`+`/`-` lines) form a **contiguous group** (no unchanged context lines between separate groups of changes):

1. Remove lines starting with `-` (deletions).
2. For lines starting with `+`, remove the leading `+` prefix. If a single space follows the `+`, remove that space as well (it is the diff marker separator, not part of the code). If no space follows the `+` (e.g., an empty added line), remove only the `+`.
3. The result is the raw replacement code -- store it in `suggestion`.

Example:

Review file:

```diff
- const result = unsafeOperation(input);
+ const result = safeOperation(sanitize(input));
```

Extracted `suggestion` (raw replacement code):

```
const result = safeOperation(sanitize(input));
```

**Keep as markdown diff** (complex case) -- when **any** of these conditions is true:

- The suggestion contains **multiple** ` ```diff ``` ` blocks
- The diff block contains **non-contiguous changes** (changed lines separated by unchanged context lines, indicating edits at distant locations within the file)

In this case:

1. Do **not** set the `suggestion` field.
2. Append the original ` ```diff ``` ` block(s) verbatim to the `explanation` text (separated by a blank line).
3. The comment will be posted as a pure observation (without a GitHub suggestion "Apply" button).

Example -- multiple diff blocks (keep as diff):

Review file:

````
```diff
- import { foo } from './utils';
+ import { foo, bar } from './utils';
```

```diff
- foo(data);
+ bar(foo(data));
```
````

Result: `suggestion` is **not set**. The two diff blocks are appended to `explanation` as-is.

Example -- non-contiguous changes within a single diff block (keep as diff):

Review file:

```diff
  function process(input) {
-   const raw = input;
+   const raw = sanitize(input);
    // ... many unchanged lines ...
    const config = loadConfig();
-   return execute(raw, config);
+   return executeSafely(raw, config);
  }
```

Result: `suggestion` is **not set**. The diff block is appended to `explanation` as-is.

### 5. Deduplicate Comments

For each issue identified in Step 4, compare against existing comments from Step 3:

- **Skip** if an existing comment on the same `path` and `line` (or nearby range +/- 5 lines) already addresses the same concern
- **Skip** if the issue is already mentioned in any top-level review body
- Use semantic comparison, not exact string matching -- if the existing comment covers the same problem, even with different wording, skip the new comment

### 6. Decision Gate

- If **no new issues** remain after deduplication (neither inline nor non-diff): **Do not submit a review.** Inform the user that no new issues were found beyond existing review comments.
- If **new issues exist** (inline, non-diff, or both): Proceed to Step 7. A review with only non-diff issues is still submitted -- the issues appear in the main review body even though there are no inline thread comments.

### 7. Submit the Review

Submit a single review via the GitHub API. The review consists of one **main review comment** with individual **thread comments** that appear as conversation threads anchored to specific lines in the diff.

**Main review comment** (`body`): See [main-review-comment.md](references/main-review-comment.md) for the full template and examples.

**Thread comments** (`comments[].body`): See [thread-comment.md](references/thread-comment.md) for the full template and examples.

#### Separating inline vs. non-diff issues

Before building the payload, split the deduplicated issues into two groups:

- **Inline issues** (`file_in_diff: true`): Posted as thread comments anchored to specific lines in the diff.
- **Non-diff issues** (`file_in_diff: false`): Cannot be posted as thread comments (the API would reject them). Instead, these are appended to the main review body as a dedicated section.

#### Determining event type

- Use `"REQUEST_CHANGES"` if **any** issue (inline or non-diff) with severity `High Priority` or `Medium Priority` remains after deduplication.
- Use `"APPROVE"` if **all** remaining issues (inline and non-diff) are `Low Priority` only.

#### Comment types

Each entry in `comments` uses one of two shapes depending on whether the issue targets a single line or a range of lines:

**Single-line comment** -- targets exactly one line in the diff:

```json
{
  "path": "src/auth.ts",
  "line": 42,
  "side": "RIGHT",
  "body": "<thread-comment>"
}
```

Required fields: `path`, `line`, `side`.

**Multi-line comment** -- targets a range from `start_line` through `line` (both inclusive, both must be within the same diff hunk):

```json
{
  "path": "src/utils.ts",
  "start_line": 10,
  "line": 14,
  "start_side": "RIGHT",
  "side": "RIGHT",
  "body": "<thread-comment>"
}
```

Required fields: `path`, `start_line`, `line`, `start_side`, `side`. The suggestion content replaces **all** lines from `start_line` through `line` verbatim.

#### Preflight validation

Run before submission:

- Validate JSON payload syntax (e.g., pipe the heredoc through `jq . >/dev/null`)
- Every comment has `path`, `line`, and `side: "RIGHT"`
- Multi-line comments additionally have `start_line` and `start_side: "RIGHT"`
- `line` (and `start_line` for ranges) falls inside the PR diff hunk for that file
- Each `body` that includes a suggestion contains ` ```suggestion ``` ` fences wrapping the raw replacement code
- Suggestion replacement code preserves indentation and exact intended final content
- Empty suggestion block (` ```suggestion\n``` `) only when the intent is to delete the selected line(s)

#### Submit command

Build the JSON payload with all comments (single-line and multi-line mixed) and submit:

```bash
gh api repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews \
  --method POST \
  --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "event": "<APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES per 'Determining event type' above>",
  "body": "<main-review-comment>",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "src/auth.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "<thread-comment>"
    },
    {
      "path": "src/utils.ts",
      "start_line": 10,
      "line": 14,
      "start_side": "RIGHT",
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "<thread-comment>"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

#### Error handling

If the API returns an error (e.g., `422 Unprocessable Entity`):

1. Parse the error response to identify which comment(s) failed (GitHub typically reports the index or the `path`/`line` that is invalid).
2. The most common cause is a `line` or `start_line` that falls outside the PR diff hunk. For each failing comment:
   - Re-fetch the diff hunk for that file (`gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER` and locate the `@@` headers for the file).
   - Verify that the `line` value falls within one of the hunk ranges. If not, adjust the line to the nearest valid line within the hunk, or drop the comment if no valid line exists.
3. Remove or fix the failing comments and retry the submission **once**. If the retry also fails, report the error to the user with the full API response and the list of comments that could not be submitted.

### 8. Report Result

Present a summary of the review submission to the user, including:

1. The PR URL for reference
2. Number of review comments submitted vs. total issues found
3. The Issues table below

#### Issues table

You **MUST** output a markdown table listing **every** issue from Step 4 with its submission status and reason. Never omit this table, even when all issues were skipped. Use the following format:

| #   | Severity        | File                | Line(s) | Title                          | Status         | Reason                            |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------- |

**Status values:**

- **Submitted** — comment was successfully posted as an inline thread comment on the PR. Reason: `—`
- **In review body** — the file is not part of the PR diff (`file_in_diff: false`), so the issue was included in the main review body under the "Additional issues outside the diff" section. Reason: `File not in diff`
- **Skipped (duplicate)** — removed during deduplication (Step 5). Reason: describe which existing comment covers it
- **Skipped (no diff line)** — the target line is not within any diff hunk and could not be adjusted. Reason: explain why
- **Failed** — the API rejected the comment and the retry also failed. Reason: include the API error detail

If no review was submitted (Step 6), explain that no new issues were found beyond existing review comments and still show the table with all issues marked as skipped.

## Important Notes

- The `line` field in review comments must reference a line that appears in the diff -- comments on unchanged lines will be rejected by the API
- For multi-line suggestions, use `start_line` and `line` together to define the range being replaced; both must be within the diff hunk
- An empty suggestion block (` ```suggestion\n``` `) means "delete these lines"
- The content inside ` ```suggestion ``` ` replaces the selected line(s) verbatim -- ensure correct indentation and formatting
- Never fabricate issues -- only flag genuine concerns backed by evidence in the code
