# Verify Requirements Coverage

Verify that a pull request or local changes fully implement the requirements described in a GitHub issue. Extracts the issue reference, analyzes the diff against the issue description, and produces a coverage report.

## Input

- **PR number or URL** (optional): The pull request identifier. Accepts:
  - Number: `123`
  - Hash-prefixed: `#123`
  - Full URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`
  - If omitted, verifies local changes instead.
- **Issue number** (optional): An issue number can be provided to check coverage against (e.g., `issue #42`). Works in both remote and local modes. In remote mode, this overrides automatic issue detection from the PR body.
- **Diff file path** (optional): Path to a pre-existing diff file (e.g., passed by `ah-review-code`). If provided, skip fetching the diff in Step 7 and read this file instead.

## Procedure

### 1. Determine Review Target

- **Remote PR**: If the user provides a PR number or URL (e.g., "Verify PR #123"), target that remote PR. Set `MODE=remote`.
- **Local Changes**: If no specific PR is mentioned, or if the user asks to "verify my changes" or "do my changes cover the issue", target the current local changes (staged and unstaged). Set `MODE=local`.

### 2. Resolve Identifier

**If `MODE=remote`:**

Extract the PR number from the user input. Strip any `#` prefix or parse the number from a URL.

```
PR_NUMBER=<extracted number>
```

**If `MODE=local`:**

Determine the current branch name and base branch for identification and diffing.

```bash
BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-')

# Determine the base (source) branch using this priority:
# 1. If an open/draft PR exists for the current branch, use its base branch.
# 2. Fall back to the repository's default branch.
# 3. Last resort: "main".
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q '.baseRefName' 2>/dev/null || gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q '.defaultBranchRef.name' 2>/dev/null || git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||')
BASE_BRANCH=${BASE_BRANCH:-main}

# Find the point where the current branch diverged from the base branch.
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base "${BASE_BRANCH}" HEAD)
```

### 3. Fetch Metadata

**If `MODE=remote`:**

Gather PR details including body and linked issues. Resolve the repository owner and name for later use in API calls.

```bash
PR_META=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json number,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,files,url)
PR_BODY=$(echo "$PR_META" | jq -r '.body')

# Resolve repository owner and name for API calls (e.g., GraphQL in Step 4).
REPO_OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner -q '.owner.login')
REPO_NAME=$(gh repo view --json name -q '.name')
```

**If `MODE=local`:**

Gather the list of changed files on the branch (committed and unstaged tracked changes) relative to the base branch. Note: untracked files (new files not yet `git add`-ed) are not included.

```bash
git diff --name-only "${MERGE_BASE}"
```

### 4. Extract Linked Issue Number

**If `MODE=remote`:**

Determine the related issue using these methods in priority order:

**Method A -- User-provided issue number:** If the user explicitly provided an issue number (e.g., "verify PR 123, issue #42"), use that directly. Skip Methods B–D.

**Method B -- Closing keywords in PR body:**

Search `$PR_BODY` (from Step 3) for GitHub closing keywords followed by an issue reference:

- `closes #N`, `fixes #N`, `resolves #N` (and their variants: `close`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolved`)
- Full URL references: `closes https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/N`

**Method C -- GitHub linked issues API:**

```bash
gh api graphql \
  -F owner="$REPO_OWNER" \
  -F repo="$REPO_NAME" \
  -F pr_number=$PR_NUMBER \
  -f query='
    query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr_number: Int!) {
      repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
        pullRequest(number: $pr_number) {
          closingIssuesReferences(first: 10) {
            nodes { number title }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.closingIssuesReferences.nodes'
```

**Method D -- Issue reference in PR body:**

If Methods A–C yield no results, scan `$PR_BODY` for any `#N` pattern or issue URL that is not a closing keyword reference. After extracting candidate numbers, verify each is an actual issue (not a PR) by checking for the absence of a `pull_request` key:

```bash
# Returns empty if $N is a PR, returns the issue number if it is an issue.
gh api "repos/${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/issues/$N" --jq 'select(.pull_request == null) | .number'
```

**If `MODE=local`:**

Determine the related issue using these methods in priority order:

**Method A -- User-provided issue number:** If the user explicitly provided an issue number (e.g., "verify my changes against issue #42"), use that directly.

**Method B -- Branch name convention:** Extract an issue number from the branch name if it follows a convention like `feature/42-description`, `fix/42`, `issue-42-description`, `42-description`, `jj/42-description`, etc.

```bash
# Extract the first number that appears after a slash or dash boundary (or at the start).
# Matches: feature/42-desc, fix/42, issue-42-desc, 42-desc, jj/42-desc
ISSUE_NUMBER=$(git branch --show-current | grep -oP '(?:^|[/-])(\d+)' | head -1 | grep -oP '\d+')
```

**No issue found:** If no linked issue can be determined, inform the user and stop. Do not guess or fabricate an issue number.

```
ISSUE_NUMBER=<extracted number>
```

If multiple issues are found, process each one and produce a separate coverage report per issue.

### 5. Fetch Issue Details

Retrieve the full issue description:

```bash
gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json number,title,body,labels
```

### 6. Extract Requirements from Issue

Parse the issue body and title to identify discrete, testable requirements. Look for:

- Checklist items (`- [ ]` or `- [x]`)
- Numbered steps or acceptance criteria
- Explicit behavioral descriptions ("should", "must", "when X then Y")
- UI changes, API changes, or data model changes mentioned
- Edge cases or error handling requirements
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility)

Produce a numbered list of requirements:

```
R1: <requirement description>
R2: <requirement description>
...
```

If the issue body is vague or contains no clear requirements, use the issue title and any available context to infer the expected behavior. Flag inferred requirements clearly.

### 7. Fetch Diff

**If a diff file path was provided as input**, read the diff from that file instead of fetching it. Skip the commands below and proceed to Step 8.

**If `MODE=remote`:**

Get the full diff for the pull request:

```bash
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER
```

Also review the list of changed files from Step 3 to understand the scope of changes.

**If `MODE=local`:**

Diff from the merge base (resolved in Step 2) to the current working tree. This captures all changes on the feature branch — both committed and unstaged tracked changes — relative to the base branch. Note: untracked files (new files not yet `git add`-ed) are not included.

```bash
git diff "${MERGE_BASE}"
```

Also review the list of changed files from Step 3 to understand the scope of changes.

### 8. Analyze Coverage

For each requirement from Step 6, determine whether the diff addresses it:

- **Covered**: The diff contains code changes that directly implement the requirement
- **Partially covered**: The diff addresses some aspects but misses edge cases or details
- **Not covered**: No code changes in the diff relate to this requirement

Use evidence from the diff to justify each assessment. Do not speculate -- base judgments on actual code changes.

Calculate the coverage percentage: `coverage = (fully covered count / total requirements) × 100`, rounded to the nearest integer. Partially covered requirements do **not** count toward the covered total -- they are treated the same as "Not covered" for the percentage calculation, but are still distinguished in the report table.

### 9. Produce Report

Set `TARGET` label based on mode:
- `MODE=remote`: `PR #<PR_NUMBER>`
- `MODE=local`: `branch ${BRANCH_NAME}`

Generate the report using the coverage analysis from Step 8.

**If all requirements are covered (100% coverage):**

```
## Requirements Coverage: 100%

All requirements from issue #<ISSUE_NUMBER> are implemented in <TARGET>.

### Requirements
| # | Requirement | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| R1 | <description> | Covered |
| R2 | <description> | Covered |

### Summary
<2-3 sentences confirming full coverage, highlighting key implementation decisions>
```

**If any requirements are missing or partially covered:**

```
## Requirements Coverage: <percentage>%

<TARGET> does not fully implement issue #<ISSUE_NUMBER>.

### Requirements
| # | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|-------|
| R1 | <description> | Covered | |
| R2 | <description> | Not covered | <what is missing> |
| R3 | <description> | Partially covered | <what is incomplete> |

### Missing Implementation
<For each uncovered or partially covered requirement, describe specifically what code changes are needed to complete the implementation>

### Summary
<2-3 sentences describing the overall gap between the issue requirements and the current implementation>
```

### 10. Report to User

Present the coverage report from Step 9. Include:

- The issue number and title for context
- `MODE=remote`: the PR URL for reference; `MODE=local`: the branch name and list of changed files
- The coverage percentage
- Clear next steps if coverage is incomplete

## Important Notes

- Never fabricate requirements that are not present or implied in the issue
- If the issue lacks acceptance criteria, clearly state which requirements were inferred from context
- Do not evaluate code quality -- this skill only checks implementation completeness against the issue description
- For issues with sub-tasks or linked child issues, only evaluate the requirements in the specific linked issue
- When multiple issues are linked, report coverage for each issue separately
- In `MODE=local`, the diff comes from `git diff "${MERGE_BASE}"` (all committed and unstaged tracked changes on the branch relative to the base branch; untracked files are not included) instead of a PR diff. The issue must be provided by the user or extracted from the branch name — if neither yields a result, inform the user and stop
